# RestaurantMealBuilder---Davio
For the C++ ticketing system, a customer builds their menu, having prices easily shown for each item ordered. In addition, gratuity is added for the customer (taxes are hardcoded within system). A final bill will be produced for the customer when they state they are finished ordering. 

To improve this WIP, I need to address 1) deleting items from the ticket, and 2) prevent the header/menu from reloading each time within the program.
